## Overview

This program takes a list of objects, and sorts them into a Hashtable. This program
does its sorting as both a Linear Probing method, as well using a double Hash method.


## Reflection

This project was difficult to debug. The large size of what was being implemented
as a hash table made it really difficult, especially if the errors were super deep into
a list. My understanding of HashTables were better than our previous project with MaxHeap,
so much of my initial code was somewhat correct, but the debugging took a lot more time than before.

I do feel that I really understand the implementation a lot more, and what the different
factors mean, and why they are important. For example, the relation of the load factor,
size, number of elements, and capacity was something that I never really grasped until
recently, but this project made me really understand how they work together so I could properly
implement a table.

## Compiling and Using

 To compile the code: \
    $ javac *.java \
 This will compile all the needed java files in the folder.

Then, to use the main program, HashtableExperiment, follow these guidelines in the terminal:\
java HashtableExperiment dataSource loadFactor [debugLevel] \
dataSource: 1 for random numbers, 2 for dates, 3 for word list \
loadFactor:  The ratio of objects to table size, denoted by Î± = n/m \
debugLevel: \
0 ==> print summary of experiment \
1 ==> same as 0 and dump the two hash tables to files at end \
2 ==> print debugging output for each insert
